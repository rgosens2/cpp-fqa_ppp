Linking to the FQA
{}
If you liked the FQA and wish to spread the word, here are some images
for the link face. If you link to the FQA or just found it interesting,
I'd be happy if you dropped [http://yosefk.com me] a line.

`<h2>Plain vanilla images</h2>`

In this category, we have a /C++ FQA Lite/ image and a /Defective C++/ image in our stock.
For those suffering from webophobia like myself (I do hope nobody will ever see my publishing software):
the HTML code below each image can be pasted right into many
of the Web 2.0 thingies, such as blog update screens.

`<h2>Images with keywords in them</h2>`

Now that's what I call [35.14 "designing keywords"].

`<b>WARNING:</b>` The next image is incomprehensible for people who didn't undergo a prolonged exposure
to C++. Actually, so are many other things in the FQA... Oh, well.

This one is for people who don't like to shift output streams
to the left (copywriter: Maciej Katafiasz).

`<h2>The Horror. The Horror.</h2>`

The following rendering of a terrifying real-world analogy is especially
suitable for a blog featuring world-class cat pictures. Cat++, the cat
with the seven legs and the wing, is a better cat, but also a scalable
leg-oriented animal, not to mention excellent support for generic limbs.

Upgrade to a modern pet with more features today!

`<h2>Advertising the infrastructure of your site</h2>`

Remember all those "Powered by |Something|" banners, showing off the inner workings of a site?
Well, now you can impress the tech-savvy visitors, conveying a strong feeling of reliability and security:

`<a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa">
<img src="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/images/not-crippled.png"
     alt="[This site is not crippled by C++]">
</a>`
@
<a href="http:\/\/yosefk.com\/c++fqa">
<img src="http:\/\/yosefk.com\/c++fqa\/images\/not-crippled.png"
     alt="[This site is not crippled by C++]">

What's that? Your site is running software written in C++? Then you can /really/ impress
people with the exceptional skills of the engineers behind the enterprise, who somehow manage to prevent
the whole thing from collapsing:

`<a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa">
<img src="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/images/not-entirely.png"
     alt="[This site is not entirely crippled by C++]">

`<h2>Exclusively for hardware designers: Say No to SystemC</h2>`

[http://www.systemc.org SystemC] is a hardware description pseudo-language,
implemented as a C++ [35.1 template] library. Other implementations are possible for
the "synthesizable subset"; these, of course, defeat the purpose of using C++,
since the subset is essentially a more verbose version of a real HDL.

SystemC brings the fun experienced daily by millions of software developers
to the desk of the hardware designer. Well, there is one difference - the software developers are of course at
a much better position when it comes to dealing with the quirks of C++, such as [13.1 operator overloading].
But the funniest thing about SystemC is the /name/ - specifically, the lack
of the two plus signs in it. The pesky plus signs would scare off the embedded
software engineers who frequently hang out with hardware hackers, so off they went - C++ marketing played backwards!
Sadly enough, those embedded engineers largely [33.3 didn't do a very good job] explaining
their attitude towards C++, and the time came to pay for it, watching C++ code invading their world.

Here's a link face for people who don't like the combination of the clarity
of C++ and the simulation speed of RTL:
