<h2>[18.1] What is &quot;<code>const</code> correctness&quot;?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.1">FAQ:</a></b> Oh, that&#39;s a great thing. You declare an object as <code>const</code> and prevent it from being modified.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you pass a <code>std::string</code> object to a function by <code>const</code> pointer or reference, the function
won&#39;t modify it and it won&#39;t be copied the way it happens when the object is passed by value.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Interesting. What about vector of pointers to objects? Let&#39;s see. If the vector itself is declared
<code>const</code> (as in <code>const std::vector&lt;T*&gt;</code>), then you can&#39;t modify the vector, but you can modify the objects.
If the pointers are declared <code>const</code> (as in <code>std::vector&lt;const T*&gt;</code>), then you can modify the vector,
but not the objects. Now suppose you have a vector of non-<code>const</code> objects, and you want to pass them to a function
that accepts a <code>const</code> vector of <code>const</code> objects. Oops, can&#39;t do that - the vectors are two different unrelated types
as far as the compiler is concerned (no, C++ weenies, it actually <a href="const.html#fqa-18.17">doesn't</a> make sense, think again). You&#39;ll have to create a temporary vector of the right type and copy
the pointers (which will compile just fine since <code>T*</code> is silently convertible to <code>const T*</code>).
</p>

<p>
That&#39;s what <code>const</code> correctness is all about: increasing the readability of your program and protecting
you from errors without any performance penalties.
</p>

<p>
By the way, not using <code>const</code> in C++ is quite likely <i>not</i> a very good idea. Of all questionable C++ features, <code>const</code> probably
does the most visible damage when avoided. Any piece of code using <code>const</code> forces every other piece touching it to use
<code>const</code>, or else you won&#39;t be able to work with the objects it gives you. And here&#39;s the funny part: every
piece of code <i>not</i> using <code>const</code> forces every other piece touching it <i>to not use it, either</i> - or else you
won&#39;t be able to pass objects to it. So if you have one <code>const</code> particle and one anti-<code>const</code> particle,
there&#39;s a big shiny explosion of <code>const_cast</code> in your code. Since <code>const</code> is hard-wired into the
language (no way to pass a temporary to a function that gets a non-const reference, for example) and the standard library
(<code>iterator</code> and <code>const_iterator</code>), using <code>const</code> is usually a safer bet than avoiding it.
</p>


<a id="fqa-18.2"></a>
<h2>[18.2] How is &quot;<code>const</code> correctness&quot; related to ordinary type safety?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.2">FAQ:</a></b> It&#39;s one form of type safety. You can think about <code>const std::string</code> as an <i>almost</i> separate type that lacks
certain operations of a string, like assignment. If you find type safety useful, you&#39;ll also like <code>const</code> correctness.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> It&#39;s related to ordinary type safety in a pretty complicated way. <code>const</code> and <code>volatile</code> are special cases
in the type system - they are &quot;type qualifiers&quot;. The relation between a qualified type and a non-qualified type
is different from any other relation between types in the language. This is one of the very many complications
in the implicit conversion and overload resolution rules.
</p>

<p>
It works smoothly for the simple cases, especially if there are no other complications. It breaks pretty hard
whenever you have a pointer-like object. Pointers can get <i>two</i> const qualifiers, one for the pointer and one for the pointed values.
This is awkward and unreadable and when you have pointers to pointers and three const qualifiers, you may need
cryptic explicit casts, but at least there&#39;s syntax for all the levels of constness. With &quot;smart pointers&quot; (the
things you should stuff into <a href="exceptions.html#fqa-17.4">every possible hole</a> because pointers are <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.15">evil</a>), there&#39;s no such syntax. That&#39;s why
we have <code>iterator</code> and <code>const_iterator</code> - saying <code>const iterator</code> says that the iterator is immutable, but not
what it points to. Exercise: implement a vector-like class that can get the storage pointer from the user,
in a const-correct way that supports attaching both to constant and mutable storage areas.
</p>

<p>
And of course a vector of <code>const</code> pointers is compiled to a different bulk of (identical) assembly code
than a vector of mutable pointers. At least here the compiler is writing the same program twice, which is
better than having to do this yourself. Which also happens - <code>const_iterator</code> is one family of examples.
</p>


<a id="fqa-18.3"></a>
<h2>[18.3] Should I try to get things <code>const</code> correct &quot;sooner&quot; or &quot;later&quot;?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.3">FAQ:</a></b> As soon as possible, because when you add <code>const</code> to a piece of code, it triggers changes in every place
related to it.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> That&#39;s right. Since you can&#39;t get out of the tar pit, the best strategy is to climb right into the middle
and make yourself comfortable from the beginning. No kidding, I actually agree with the FAQ.

<a id="fqa-18.4"></a>
<h2>[18.4] What does &quot;<code>const Fred* p</code>&quot; mean?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.4">FAQ:</a></b> A pointer to a <code>const Fred</code> object. The object can&#39;t be changed, for example, you can&#39;t call methods not qualified
as <code>const</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Right. But don&#39;t count on it when you debug code. <code>const</code> can be cast away in a snap (pretty much like everything
else in C++), and there&#39;s the <code>mutable</code> keyword for creating members that can be modified by methods qualified as <code>const</code>.
And of course someone can have <i>another</i>, non-const pointer to the same <code>Fred</code> object. <i>And</i> the <code>const</code>-qualified methods may modify
data pointed by its member pointers and references or by pointers kept in things pointed by its member pointers, etc.
</p>

<p>
The pointer aliasing issue is one reason that the compiler <i>can&#39;t</i> really optimize code because it sees a pointer declared
as <code>const</code>. And when it <i>can</i> figure out there are no aliases, it <i>doesn&#39;t need</i> your const declarations to help it. You
can explain the difference between data flow analysis and type qualification to the next <a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.9">pseudo-performance-aware</a>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.5">FAQ:</a></b> In the first example, the object is immutable. In the second example, the pointer is immutable. In the third example,

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Which is similar to a pointer to an immutable Fred object. However, the FAQ holds the <a href="ref.html#fqa-8.6">"references are NOT pointers"</a>
religion (specifically, it belongs to the &quot;pointers are <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.15">evil</a>&quot; faction), so it dutifully replicates the explanation given
in the <a href="const.html#fqa-18.4">answer</a> about the pointer case, replacing &quot;pointer&quot; with &quot;reference&quot;.

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.7">FAQ:</a></b> No. It says that you can change the object, but not the reference. But you can never change a reference anyway, it will
always refer to a single object.
</p>

<p>
Don&#39;t write such declarations, it confuses people.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> So <a href="inheritance-multiple.html#fqa-25.13">why does this compile</a>? Wait, I don&#39;t really want to know. Whether it&#39;s because they didn&#39;t bother to disallow it,
or because some special case of template instantiation (like when you add a <code>const</code> to a parameter type which is in fact a reference)
would fail or anything like that - that&#39;s just another lame excuse as far as a language user is concerned.

<h2>[18.10] What is a &quot;<code>const</code> member function&quot;?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.10">FAQ:</a></b> It&#39;s declared by appending <code>const</code> to the prototype of a class member function. Only this kind of methods may be
called when you have a <code>const</code> object. Errors are caught at compile time, without any speed or space penalty.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> As discussed above, this <a href="const.html#fqa-18.2">breaks into little pieces</a> when your class is similar to a pointer in the sense that
a user can change both the state of your object and use your object to change some other state. As to the speed
and space penalty, you may check the symbol table of your program if you want to know how many functions were
<a href="templates.html#fqa-35.10">generated twice from a single template</a> because of <code>const</code> and non-<code>const</code> template parameters. Then you can count
the functions having identical code except for extra <code>const</code> qualifiers in some versions, but not others.
</p>


<a id="fqa-18.11"></a>
<h2>[18.11] What&#39;s the relationship between a return-by-reference and a <code>const</code> member function?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.11">FAQ:</a></b> <code>const</code> member functions returning references to class members should use a <code>const</code> reference. Many times the compiler
will catch you when you violate this rule. Sometimes it won&#39;t. You have to think.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> <i>Of course</i> you have to think about this complete and utter nonsense! Somebody has to, and the C++ designers didn&#39;t.
</p>

<p>
As usual with <code>const</code>, the compiler becomes <a href="const.html#fqa-18.2">dumb</a> when levels of indirection appear. For instance, if you keep a member
reference, the thing it points to is not considered part of the object. It&#39;s up to you to decide whether you want
to return this reference as <code>const</code> or non-<code>const</code> from your <code>const</code> member accessor. Both choices may eventually
lead to <code>const_cast</code>.
</p>


<a id="fqa-18.12"></a>
<h2>[18.12] What&#39;s the deal with &quot;<code>const</code>-overloading&quot;?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.12">FAQ:</a></b> You can have two member functions with a single difference in the prototype - the trailing <code>const</code>. The compiler
will select the function based on whether the <code>this</code> argument is <code>const</code> or not. For instance, a class with a subscript
operator may have two versions: one returning mutable objects and one returning <code>const</code> objects - in the latter version,
<code>this</code> is also qualified as <code>const</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> <i>Please try to avoid this feature</i>. In particular, get and set functions having the same name (<code>const</code>-overloaded)
are not a very good idea.
</p>

<p>
Having to replicate the code of a subscript operator just to add two <code>const</code> qualifiers - for the return value and
the <code>this</code> argument - is yet another example of <code>const</code> forcing you to write your program twice. Well, most likely
there are more problems where this one came from. A class with a subscript operator is a &quot;smart array&quot;,
probably not unlike <code>std::vector</code>, so you&#39;ll end up with much more replicated code - an <code>iterator</code> and a
<code>const_iterator</code> or some such.
</p>


<a id="fqa-18.13"></a>
<h2>[18.13] What do I do if I want a <code>const</code> member function to make an &quot;invisible&quot; change to a data member?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.13">FAQ:</a></b> There are legitimate use cases for this - that would be when a user doesn&#39;t see the change using the interface
of the class. For example, a set class may cache the last look-up to possibly speed up the next look-up.
</p>

<p>
Use the <code>mutable</code> keyword when you declare the members you want to change this way. If your compiler doesn&#39;t have
<code>mutable</code>, use <code>const_cast&lt;Set*&gt;(this)</code> or the like. However, try to avoid this because it can lead to undefined behavior
if the object was originally declared as <code>const</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Most compilers probably support <code>mutable</code> today, but you may still need <code>const_cast</code> because the tweaks to the
type system supporting <code>const</code> <a href="const.html#fqa-18.2">break in many cases</a>. Which may be a problem combined with the fact that
<code>const_cast</code> is not designed to work with objects declared as <code>const</code> (as opposed to those declared non-constant but passed to a function by <code>const</code> reference or pointer).
</p>

<p>
There are numerous reasons making <code>const_cast</code> safer in practice than in theory. People rarely declare objects as <code>const</code>.
Compiler writers are unlikely to add special cases to their compiler to support <code>const</code> objects of C++ classes because it&#39;s hard work
that is unlikely to pay off. For example, allocating a global <code>const</code> C-style structure with an aggregate initializer in read-only
memory is easy. Doing the same for a C++ class with a constructor is hard because the constructor must be able to
write to the object upon initialization. So you&#39;d have to use writable memory you later make read-only, which is not
typically supported by object file formats and operating systems. Or you could translate C++ code to a C-style aggregate
initializer, spending lots of effort to only handle the cases when the compiler can <a href="inline.html#fqa-9.1">inline</a> the code of the constructors.
</p>

<p>
However, there is no simple rule making it &quot;very close to impossible&quot; for a compiler writer to use the opportunity
provided by the standard and implement <code>const</code> objects differently from other objects. In the case of <a href="const.html#fqa-18.4">optimizing</a>
the dereferencing of <code>const</code> pointers, such a rule does exist (there might be other, non-<code>const</code> pointers to the same location).
But in the case of objects declared <code>const</code>, there <i>should</i> be no such pointers.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the compiler is allowed
to work under this assumption could be great if it were more likely to actually yield performance benefits, and
if <code>const</code> worked to an extent making the use of <code>const_cast</code> unnecessary. The current state of affairs just
creates another source of uncertainty for the programmer.
</p>


<a id="fqa-18.14"></a>
<h2>[18.14] Does <code>const_cast</code> mean lost optimization opportunities?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.14">FAQ:</a></b> Theoretically, yes. In practice, no. If a compiler knows that a value used in a piece of code
is not modified, it can optimize the access to that value, for example, fetch it to a machine register.
However, the compiler can&#39;t be sure that a value pointed by a <code>const</code> pointer is not modified because
of the aliasing problem: there can be other pointers to the same object, not necessarily constant.
Proving the opposite is almost always impossible.
</p>

<p>
And when the compiler can&#39;t prove it, it can&#39;t speed up the access to the value. For example, if it
uses the value it fetched to a register after someone modified it in the original memory location,
the compiler changes the meaning of the program because it uses an outdated value.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Three cheers to the FAQ! No, really, this time the answer describes the actual state of affairs.
You understand why I&#39;m so deeply touched if you met some of <a href="const.html#fqa-18.4">the many C++ users</a> who
give a different answer to this question, and know their <a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.9">ways</a> to reason about performance.
</p>

<p>
I think the answer is &quot;no&quot; in theory, too, because basically the compiler has to figure out which parts of
the code modify the data, and if it knows the data won&#39;t get modified while this piece of code is running, it can use
this fact, and otherwise it can&#39;t, so what difference do your <code>const</code>-qualifications make? But let&#39;s
say I&#39;m not really sure, and anyway, it&#39;s not the time to argue about the exact phrasing when once in
a lifetime a realistic statement appears about the performance of C++ code.
</p>

<p>
The thing that is worth noting is that aliasing problems impede the performance of &quot;generic&quot; libraries, not just compilers.
For example, consider <code>vector&lt;T&gt;::push_back()</code>. The vector will try to append the object to its storage.
If there&#39;s no free space left, it will allocate a larger chunk, copy the old objects, and then append the
new one. The new object is thus copied once (from wherever it was into the vector storage), right?
</p>

<p>
But what if the object <a href="assign.html#fqa-12.2">is itself located in the old chunk</a>, and <code>vector</code> tries to be efficient and use <code>realloc</code>, which
may or may not free the old memory? The object may be wiped out by <code>realloc</code>. Very good, then, <code>vector</code>
creates <i>another</i> copy. Hop 1 - from the parameter to a temporary, hop 2 - from a temporary to the vector storage
and everyone is happy - after a certain amount of clock cycles.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Theoretically, yes. In practice, no.&quot; Quite a nice summary of C++.

<h2>[18.15] Why does the compiler allow me to change an <code>int</code> after I&#39;ve pointed at it with a <code>const int*</code>?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.15">FAQ:</a></b> Because when you point to something with a <code>const</code> pointer, this only means that you can&#39;t
use that pointer to change the object. It doesn&#39;t mean the object can&#39;t be changed at
all, because it can be accessible in other ways, not only through this pointer.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Exactly; it&#39;s related to the previous FAQ. Surprisingly for C++, it even makes sense.
After all, when the object is <i>declared</i>, it seems like the right place to say what can be done with it.
But if anyone can take an existing object
and point to it and thus redefine what can be done with it, it&#39;s just weird, and can&#39;t really
work, because it could be done from many places in incompatible ways.

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-18.17">FAQ:</a></b> It would be &quot;invalid and dangerous&quot;! Suppose <code>Foo**</code> points to an array of pointers, which
can be used to modify the pointed objects. Suppose C++ would allow to pass this array to a function
which expects <code>const Foo**</code> - an array of pointers which <i>can&#39;t</i> be used to modify the pointed objects.
</p>

<p>
Now suppose that this function fills the array with a bunch of pointers to <i>constant</i> objects.
This looks perfectly good in that context, because that&#39;s what the function was passed - an
array of pointers to constant objects. But what we&#39;ve got now is an array of pointers which can be used to modify those <code>const</code> objects,
because the declaration of the array does allow such modifications!
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s a good thing we get a compile time error instead. Don&#39;t use casts to work around this!

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Wonderful. But why are we discussing evil built-in pointers anyway? Let&#39;s talk about the smart

<code>const std::vector&lt;const T*&gt;&amp;</code>? The function clearly says that it&#39;s not going to modify <i>anything</i>:
neither the vector nor the pointed objects. Why can&#39;t I pass my mutable vector of mutable objects
to a function that promises not to modify either of those?
