<h2>[9.1] What&#39;s the deal with inline functions?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.1">FAQ:</a></b> Inlining a function call means that the compiler inserts the code of the function into the calling code
(which is technically different, but logically similar to the expansion of <code>#define</code> macros). This may
 improve performance, because the compiler optimizes the callee code in the context of the calling code
 instead of implementing a function call. However, the performance impact depends on lots of things.
</p>

<p>
There&#39;s more than one way to say that a function should be inline, some of which use the <code>inline</code>
 keyword and some don&#39;t. No matter what way you use, the compiler might actually inline the function
 and it might not - you&#39;re just giving it a &quot;hint&quot;. Sounds vague? It is - and it is <i>good</i>: it lets
 the compiler generate better and/or more debuggable code.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> To summarize: the compiler has the right to inline or not inline any function, whether it&#39;s declared
 inline in any of the several ways or not. Doesn&#39;t this make &quot;inline functions&quot; a meaningless term?
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s impossible to make any sense of this without <a href="inheritance-mother.html#fqa-23.5">discussing the history of actual implementations</a>
 of the C language tool chain - compilers, assemblers and linkers. A straight-forward C implementation
 (which originally <i>all</i> of them were) works like this. First, a compiler generates assembly code from
 each source file, <i>separately</i> (without looking at other source files). Then the assembler converts
 the assembly code to an &quot;object file&quot;, where &quot;object&quot; means &quot;a sequence of bytes&quot; (talk about &quot;object oriented&quot;).
 For example, a function
 is one kind of &quot;object&quot; - the bytes encode the machine instructions the compiler used to implement it.
</p>

<p>
The values of the bytes making up these &quot;objects&quot; are almost completely finalized at this stage.
 The only kind of &quot;unknowns&quot; is addresses of &quot;objects&quot; - when an &quot;object&quot; refers to an address of another &quot;object&quot;
 (say, a function calls another function), the assembler can&#39;t compute the actual values of the bytes making up
 the function call instructions.
 This is done by the linker, which allocates the &quot;objects&quot; (basically by concatenating them).
 The linker then resolves the references (such as function calls) to the addresses of the &quot;objects&quot;.
</p>

<p>
What this means is that the <i>only</i> way to inline functions is to <code>#include</code> their definition in the header file -
otherwise, the compiler doesn&#39;t see the code of the function, and the linker can&#39;t do inlining, because all it
 sees is byte sequences, and it would have to <i>decompile</i> them first. Which explains why you need to
 include the source code of inline functions in header files, but doesn&#39;t explain why you need an <code>inline</code>
 keyword and other ways to explicitly declare a function as &quot;inline&quot;. After all, the compiler is free to ignore
 these hints, so what&#39;s their point?
</p>

<p>
Well, the point is that the compiler can&#39;t tell an <code>#include</code>d function from one written in your source file, because
 that&#39;s how C preprocessing works - the compiler only sees one large file of code. So unless you explicitly declare the
 <code>#include</code>d functions &quot;inline&quot;, it will generate their code like it does with normal functions. Then the linker
 will complain about multiple definitions.
</p>

<p>
Here&#39;s how code is compiled by many modern compilers, including some C and C++ compilers. The compiler transforms
 the source code to an intermediate representation, &quot;lower&quot; than the source language but &quot;higher&quot; than assembly language.
 This makes it possible to do inlining at link time, either on a per-library or a whole-program basis. The machine
 code is only generated as the final linkage step, or it can even be delayed until run time (the so called &quot;just in time compilation&quot;).
This way, you don&#39;t have to split your functions to &quot;inline&quot; (those that <i>can</i> be inlined, but the compiler gets to decide if they actually <i>are</i> inlined) and the rest (those that just <i>can&#39;t</i> be inlined).
Instead, you let the compiler make the decision for <i>all</i> functions. Unfortunately, the meaning of C and C++ is defined with
the old sort of implementation in mind, and having newer, more sophisticated implementations around can&#39;t change it.
</p>


<a id="fqa-9.2"></a>
<h2>[9.2] What&#39;s a simple example of procedural integration?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.2">FAQ:</a></b> There&#39;s an example of a function calling another function and how inlining may save you copying the parameters
when you pass them to a function and copying the result it returns and stuff. There&#39;s also a disclaimer saying that
it&#39;s just an example and many different things can happen.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Basically, code may be portable, but <i>performance</i> is typically not. For example, inlining a function may make code faster
or slower, depending on lots of things discussed in the next FAQs. This is one reason to leave the decision to
a compiler, because &quot;it understands the target platform better&quot;. This is also a reason to leave the decision to a human,
because compilers <i>don&#39;t</i> really know the target platform very well (they know the target processor but not the entire system),
and because they don&#39;t understand the problem you are solving <i>at all</i> (so they can&#39;t tell how many times each piece
of code is likely to run, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the problem of &quot;helping the compiler to optimize code&quot; by adding &quot;hints&quot; to the code,
especially portable code, is quite hard. There are many things similar to inlining in this respect (for example, loop unrolling).
Which is why there&#39;s no <code>unroll</code> keyword forcing loop unrolling. And the <code>inline</code> keyword only exists
because there&#39;s <a href="inline.html#fqa-9.1">no better way</a> to <i>enable</i> (as opposed to &quot;force&quot;) inlining in C/C++.
</p>


<a id="fqa-9.3"></a>
<h2>[9.3] Do <code>inline</code> functions improve performance?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.3">FAQ:</a></b> Sometimes they do, sometimes they don&#39;t. There&#39;s no simple answer.
</p>

<p>
Inlining can make code faster by eliminating function call overhead, or slower by generating too much code, causing
instruction cache misses. It may make it larger by replicating all that callee code, or smaller by saving the
instructions used to implement function calls. It may inflate the code of an innermost loop, causing repeated
cache misses, or it may improve the locality of reference in the loop, by compiling all relevant code at adjacent
addresses. It may also be irrelevant for performance, because your system is not CPU-bound.
</p>

<p>
See? Told you there was no simple answer.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> However, there <i>is</i> a relatively simple answer to the legitimate question: &quot;Why do we need this language feature
if its effect is undefined?&quot;. See <a href="inline.html#fqa-9.1">the first FAQ</a> in the section. There&#39;s also a relatively simple &amp; useful rule saying that
functions which have short code and/or are typically called with compile time constant arguments so that most of their code
computes a constant are typically good candidates for inlining. Long functions are typically worse candidates for inlining,
because the function call overhead is negligible compared to the things the functions actually do, and the main problem with
inlining - large code size - becomes dominant.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s usually a good idea to only explicitly enable the inlining of very short functions, and performance considerations
are not the only reason. In C++ you have to place the code in header files to enable inlining. While the run time performance may or may not improve, the <i>compile time</i> performance is guaranteed
to drop. Which means changing code becomes hard, which means you&#39;ll do your best to <i>not</i> change it, which means you&#39;ll
leave wrong things unfixed. And debuggers handle inlined code pretty poorly (typically
                                                                          you can&#39;t inspect the local variables
of inlined functions or even step through their source code lines),
so debugging the optimized (production) build becomes harder. And debugging a special &quot;debug&quot; build is not always possible
(some bugs won&#39;t reproduce in that build), not to mention that you have to spend time building those binaries, too.
</p>

<p>
If your application is not CPU bound, <a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.9">you aren't getting any benefits</a> from using an unsafe language like C++ except for extra quality time
 with the debugger.
</p>


<a id="fqa-9.4"></a>
<h2>[9.4] How can <code>inline</code> functions help with the tradeoff of safety vs. speed?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.4">FAQ:</a></b> &quot;In straight C&quot; you could implement encapsulation using a <code>void*</code>, so that users can&#39;t access the underlying data.
 Instead, the users have to call functions which access that data by casting the <code>void*</code> to the right type first.
</p>

<p>
Not only is this type-unsafe - it&#39;s also costly, since the simplest access now involves a function call. In C++ you
 can use <code>inline</code> accessors to <code>private</code> data - safe, fast.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Today C has inline functions (the FAQ probably doesn&#39;t consider the current C standard &quot;straight&quot;,
                                   I wonder why).
AFAIK they were back-ported from C++ together with <code>const</code> and other useless things.
But it&#39;s irrelevant to the question, which is about the completely wrong argument that <code>inline</code> accessors to <code>private</code>
functions are a form of &quot;high-speed encapsulation&quot;.
</p>

<p>
First, the tales about <code>void*</code> are <a href="class.html#fqa-7.5">wrong</a> - you can use forward declarations to achieve the holy grail of (compile time)
type safety. Second, <a href="inline.html#fqa-9.1">a good language implementation</a> can inline the small C-style accessors at link time. Third,
<code>private</code> provides little encapsulation - change a private member and you have to <a href="class.html#fqa-7.4">recompile</a> all code using the class.
 Fourth, most frequently <code>private</code> members with straight-forward <code>public</code> accessors are a just verbose way to implement
 a <code>public</code> member, since changing the representation is almost impossible and/or hardly useful.
</p>

<p>
And in the quite rare cases
 where it <i>is</i> possible and useful, &quot;properties&quot; - a language facility allowing to overload the <code>obj.member</code> syntax -
 could solve the problem, but C++ doesn&#39;t have properties. Or you could refactor the code automatically - if anything
 could <a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.19">reliably parse</a> it.
</p>

<p>
In the C++ world code is considered a good thing, of which there should be plenty.
 <code>private: int _n; public: int n() const { return _n; }</code> is thus better than <code>int n;</code>. The question is -
 do <i>you</i> like lots and lots of C++ code doing practically nothing?
</p>


<a id="fqa-9.5"></a>
<h2>[9.5] Why should I use <code>inline</code> functions instead of plain old <code>#define</code> macros?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.5">FAQ:</a></b> Because macros are <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.15">evil</a>. In particular, when a macro is expanded, the parameters are not evaluated before the
 expansion, but copied &quot;as is&quot; (they are interpreted as character sequences by the preprocessor, not as C++ expressions). Therefore,
 if a parameter is an expression with a side effect, such as <code>i++</code>, and the macro mentions it several times, the macro
 will expand to buggy code (for instance, <code>i</code> will get incremented many times). Or the generated code may be slow
 (when you use expressions like <code>functionTakingAgesToCompute()</code> as macro arguments).
</p>

<p>
Besides, inline functions check the argument types.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Yeah, C macros are no picnic. But see that thing about argument types? How can you write an <code>inline</code> function
 computing the maximal value of two arguments? A <code>template</code> <code>inline</code> function, you say? Try this: <code>std::max(n,5)</code>
 with <code>short n</code>.
</p>

<p>
And how should function arguments be passed - by value or by reference? &quot;By value&quot; may cause extra copying, and &quot;by reference&quot;
 may slow down the code due to aliasing problems, forcing the compiler to actually spill values to memory in order to
 pass them <i>to the code of an inlined function</i>! How&#39;s that for &quot;performance benefits&quot;? Another problem C macros don&#39;t have.
</p>

<p>
Frequently <code>inline</code> functions are better than macros, though, because the problems with macros turn out to be more severe in many cases.
<a href="ctors.html#fqa-10.6">As usual</a>, it&#39;s you who gets the interesting job of choosing between duplicate C++ facilities, each flawed in its own unique way.
</p>


<a id="fqa-9.6"></a>
<h2>[9.6] How do you tell the compiler to make a non-member function <code>inline</code>?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.6">FAQ:</a></b> Prepend the <code>inline</code> keyword to its prototype, and place the code in a header file, unless it&#39;s only used in
 a single <code>.cpp</code> file, or else you&#39;ll get errors about &quot;unresolved externals&quot; from the linker.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The FAQ&#39;s decision to avoid the <a href="inline.html#fqa-9.1">discussion</a> of the <i>reasons</i> leading to these requirements is wrong.
 Clearly people who don&#39;t understand the underlying implementation issues won&#39;t survive to live the miserable life
 of competent C++ developers. That&#39;s because in C++, the <i>underlying</i> stuff tends to climb out of the basement in
 repeated attempts to make <i>you</i> the one lying under a pile of hard, urgent, mind-numbing low-level problems.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the only legitimate excuse for telling about a totally weird language requirement and not explaining
 why it exists is brevity. See the FAQ&#39;s lengthy discussion about the performance of inline functions for a pretty good
 evidence that brevity is hardly the motivation here.
</p>


<a id="fqa-9.7"></a>
<h2>[9.7] How do you tell the compiler to make a member function <code>inline</code>?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.7">FAQ:</a></b> Declare the function in the class as usual. In the definition, add the <code>inline</code> keyword to the prototype.
The definition must be in a header file.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Yep, it&#39;s similar to non-member functions.
</p>


<a id="fqa-9.8"></a>
<h2>[9.8] Is there another way to tell the compiler to make a member function <code>inline</code>?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.8">FAQ:</a></b> Yes, by writing its code right in the body of the class, instead of only writing the declaration there, and
 defining it outside of the class. This way, you don&#39;t even have to use the <code>inline</code> keyword.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s easier when you write classes, but harder when you read them, because the interface is mixed with the implementation.
 Remember the &quot;reuse-oriented world&quot;? Think about the welfare of the many, many users of your class!
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> What popular language forces you to write a bare interface (&quot;header file&quot;) and separately an implementation containing
 all the information in the interface (&quot;source files&quot;)? Somehow all those languages which only make you type the interface
 once are not at all that hard to use. May it be that it&#39;s because these languages are <i>parsable</i> and therefore <i>IDEs can
 do the oh-so-interesting job of extracting the interface from the implementation</i> and then you can use things like
 class view windows to inspect interfaces?
</p>

<p>
Unless you use templates and operator overloading and all that, many IDEs even have a chance of working with your C++ code.
So writing inline functions inside class definitions won&#39;t really hurt your users after all.
Even if there were no IDEs, you should probably only inline very short functions, with implementations as descriptive
                                       as a comment (is <code>return _x;</code> less of a documentation than &quot;//returns the value of the x coordinate&quot;?). If there&#39;s lots of &quot;implementation
 details&quot; to hide from the eye of a casual observer, inlining is most likely a bad idea anyway.
</p>


<a id="fqa-9.9"></a>
<h2>[9.9] With inline member functions that are defined outside the class, is it best to put the <code>inline</code> keyword next to the declaration within the class body, next to the definition outside the class body, or both?</h2>
<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/#faq-9.9">FAQ:</a></b> The &quot;best practice&quot; is to only use it in the definition outside of the class. Blah, blah, blah, argues the FAQ
 passionately about the issue. &quot;Observable semantics&quot;, &quot;practical standpoint&quot;, blah, blah, blah.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Programmers typically have a good ability to keep many details in their heads. So good that many don&#39;t realize that
                                       this ability is
 <i>finite</i>. If you litter your brain with idiotic &quot;best practices&quot; which don&#39;t even affect the <i>observable semantics</i> of code,
you do it at the expense of <i>not</i> thinking about something else when you write code. &quot;Something else&quot; may include
 really important things, like the purpose and the meaning of the code.

If you don&#39;t care about this sort of discussions, and you find yourself under an attack of &quot;software professionals&quot; buzzing
 buzzwords about your &quot;bad practices&quot;, send them a link to this page to distract them, and use the time gained
