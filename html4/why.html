<h1>Purpose</h1>
<small class="part">Part of <a href="index.html">C++ FQA Lite</a></small><hr>

<p>
The primary purpose of the FQA is to back up the following beliefs:
</p>

<p>
Not using C++ is better than using C++. An opportunity to not use C++ is a pity to miss.
</p>

<p>
If one does use it, naive C++ is better than sophisticated C++.
It&#39;s better to accept C++ for what it is than succumb to the temptation to &quot;fix&quot; it (or &quot;<a href="http://boost.org">boost</a>&quot; it).
</p>

<p>
Expertise in the intricacies
of C++ is best viewed as a kind of martial art - something a real master never uses.
</p>

<p>
To the extent that you find the FQA informative or entertaining, it will have achieved its secondary and tertiary purposes, respectively.
