This section is about <code>operator=</code>. It&#39;s rather strange that of all possible things, people only &quot;frequently ask&quot; about self assignment, but those are the only questions listed in the FAQ.

<h2>[12.1] What is &quot;self assignment&quot;?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/assignment-operators.html#faq-12.1">FAQ:</a></b>
 It&#39;s assigning the object to itself, directly or indirectly. For example:
</p>

<pre>
void f(C&amp; x, C&amp; y) { x=y; }
void g(C&amp; x) { f(x,x); }
</pre>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> The tricky part is that the assignment operator may be overloaded, and you are expected to overload it in the
classes that &quot;own&quot; resources (most frequently memory obtained with <code>new</code>). Incidentally, these are exactly
the cases when self assignment may lead to trouble, which is why we have the next question. Which will also show
that the FAQ&#39;s definition of &quot;self assignment&quot; is unfortunately too conservative, as &quot;self&quot; is a vague concept.
</p>

<h2>[12.2] Why should I worry about &quot;self assignment&quot;?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/assignment-operators.html#faq-12.2">FAQ:</a></b>
 If you don&#39;t, your <code>operator=</code> will probably misbehave severely upon self-assignment:
</p>

<pre>
YetAnotherSoCalledSmartPointer&amp; YetAnotherSoCalledSmartPointer::operator=(const YetAnotherSoCalledSmartPointer&amp; p)
{
  delete _p;
  _p = new TheThingPointedByTheSmartPointer(*p._p);
  return *this;
}
</pre>

<p>
Self assignment will first delete <code>_p</code>, and then dereference it, which is nasty. And it is all <i>your</i> fault - you
should have handled self assignment!
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> Oh, so it&#39;s my fault, is it? Then why isn&#39;t this question listed in any other programming language FAQ on the planet?
I mean, it&#39;s the same me all the time, it&#39;s the languages that are different. So why don&#39;t we lose the feelings of guilt
and check what it is about C++ that causes the problem?
</p>

<p>
Most languages daring to call themselves &quot;object-oriented&quot; have garbage collection, so you don&#39;t spend your
time writing stupid functions for deallocating stuff, then copying stuff. These functions are all alike, but
with C++ you get to write this kind of code over and over again.
</p>

<p>
C++ doesn&#39;t have garbage collection, so a problem arises - if people are creating all those objects,
how are they going to dispose them, especially if they <a href="operator.html#fqa-13.1">overload operators</a> and do things like <code>a+b+c</code>, without
even keeping the pointers to the temporary objects created when sub-expressions are evaluated? The C++ answer is to have an &quot;owner&quot; object for
each chunk of allocated memory, and let <code>operator=</code> and the destructor worry about freeing the memory.
The most common manifestation of this quite unique language design decision is <a href="heap.html#fqa-16.1">unnecessary copying</a>,
which happens when objects are passed to functions or returned by value or &quot;cut out&quot; from larger
data structures.
</p>

<p>
The self assignment problem is another manifestation of this same thing. If objects were passed by pointers/references
and garbage-collected automatically, self assignment (setting the pointer to the value of itself) would be harmless.
And the worst part is that there are actually more cases of self assignment than <code>x=x</code>. For example, consider
<code>std::vector::push_back()</code>. What if someone passes an object from the vector itself, as in <code>v.push_back(v.back())</code>?
<code>push_back</code> may need to allocate more memory, which may cause it to free the buffer it already uses, destroying
its argument. <a href="const.html#fqa-18.2">Where</a> does the &quot;self&quot; of an object end?
</p>

<p>
You have to be really smart to get all those smart pointer and container classes right. Too bad it&#39;s still worse
than good containers <a href="picture.html#fqa-6.2">built into a language</a>.
</p>


<a id="fqa-12.3"></a>
<h2>[12.3] OK, OK, already; I&#39;ll handle self-assignment. How do I do it?</h2>

<p>
<b class="FAQ"><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/assignment-operators.html#faq-12.3">FAQ:</a></b>
 By adding a test like <code>if(this==&amp;that) { return *this; }</code> or by copying the members of the input object before deallocating members
of <code>this</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b class="FQA">FQA:</b> This avoids the destruction of your function argument via self-destruction in <code>operator=</code>.
However, there are <a href="assign.html#fqa-12.2">other cases when that can happen</a> - consider <code>std::vector::push_back()</code>.
</p>

<p>
When performance is more important to you than simplicity &amp; generality, one way to deal with this family of
problems is to document them and pass them on to the user of your code
(&quot;it is illegal to push an element of a vector into that vector, if you need to do it, copy the element explicitly&quot;).
</p>

<p>
When simplicity &amp; generality are more important than performance, you can use a language automatically tracking
references to objects, guaranteeing that used objects won&#39;t get destroyed.
